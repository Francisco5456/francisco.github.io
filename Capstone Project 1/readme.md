The main objective of the hotel business is to sell as many hotel rooms as possible, whether it is the peak season or the off season, to increase profitability. 
  <br>
Your worst nightmare as a hotelier is walking down the halls of your hotel and realising that rooms are empty. There’s a sad stillness that not only marks the sign of a quiet moment, but also the sign of a failing business strategy.
<br>
In order to avoid this situation at any point during the year – even during the slow travel season, especially now due to Covid-19 – you need to implement sales strategies that will improve business and continually bring in more guests.
